Distributed parallel computing
Explain the overall architecture of your solution.
Explain all the variations of the algorithm you have implemented.

The first algorithm to implement is the non-parallelized matrix multiplication algorithm. With this I first initiated the matrix that will
will be the one to possess the output with zeros. Then wrote two for loops to multiply the two input matrices and stored the value in the 
zero initialized matrix.
